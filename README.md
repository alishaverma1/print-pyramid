# print-pyramid
This program will use nested loops to print either a pyramid or a diamond of *â€™s of a given size. It will ask the user for the height, and then if they want a diamond pattern instead. If the user want to do the diamond, the program prints out an upside down pyramid under the first to make the diamond shape.
